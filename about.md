<p>I've been <a href="https://github.com/rodrigoalvesvieira" title="Rodrigo Alves on GitHub">programming</a> since 2010 mainly in Ruby and JavaScript. Since 2013 I also work with Java from time to time and my current passion is Swift and iOS development.</p>

<p>I've worked in two of Brazil's best startups, first <a href="https://eventick.com.br" title="Eventick">Eventick</a>, an online ticket selling and event planning platform and now <a href="http://www.inlocomedia.com" title="In Loco Media">In Loco Media</a>, the biggest and fastest-growing mobile ad network in the country.</p>

<p>I'm also a Computer Science undergraduate student at <a href="http://www2.cin.ufpe.br/site/index.php" title="CIn/UFPE">CIn/UFPE</a>, one of the finest CS schools in Brazil.</p>

<p>I speak Portuguese and English fluently.</p>

<p>Other than the programming languages and platforms mentioned above, I'm interested in <a href="https://github.com/rodrigoalvesvieira/competitive-programming" title="Algorithms and Competitive Programming code by Rodrigo Alves">Algorithms</a>, API development, Internet of Things and <a href="http://uhunt.felix-halim.net/id/207816" title="Rodrigo Alves' Uhunt Profile">Competitive Programming</a>.</p>
