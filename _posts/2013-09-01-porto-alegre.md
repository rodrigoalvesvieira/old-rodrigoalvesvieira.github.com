<span class="drops">R</span>ecently I travelled to one of Brazil's finest cities: Porto Alegre (POA). The city is the further south state capital, it is the capital city of Rio Grande do Sul.

## The City

Porto Alegre is a very green city. You get to see trees everywhere, _all-around_ 100 feet pine trees. People are generally very polite. Traffic is not so chaotic but drivers aren't usually very respectful with pedestrians either.

If you want to eat well, you will not be able to save that much money, just like in most Brazilian cities.

BTW, I guess the weather makes people wear themselves very elegantly.

If you're into public transportation, the city is not bad at it. I have not seen many crowded buses there.

Also, malls. Malls are all-the-fuck-around in the city. Which is good because its also where the movies are so often located and good food is easy to find.

Also, POA is one of the safest (low violence rates) city capitals in Brazil.

## Weather

I'm pretty sure the best time to visit POA is during the winter. As a guy from a state in northeastern Brazil, I'm used to 27-30˚ Celsius degrees range so sometimes I just wish I could experience a 5˚C climate for a few days. Porto Alegre in the winter is the perfect city for that.

## Food

If you are the carnivorous type you should go to the [Churrascaria Galpão Crioulo], the finest steak house in the city, located in downtown. They serve you delicious types of meat endlessly for the amount of R$ 50,00. Plus you eat all the amazing food watching a local folk band with dancers all around.

## Nightlife

POA features some very nice nightclubs and a great bohemian neighborhood called Cidade Baixa (low city).

Saw this monument when I was heading back to the airport

Bye, POA. I hope to be back in 2014!
